All commands to test the program are contained
in the go.sh script. Visualization is performed using
the software VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

Just make go.sh executable
> chmod 755 go.sh
and execute it
> ./go.sh 
to run all tests.

The .vmd files will produce images in the .tga format
Refer to VMD to change this.

The expected output files are found with extension .orig
and are described in the reference paper.
